# Objective: Using the "flights" dataset available
# from the data folder as flights.csv
# create a heatmap with the following parameters:
# x-axis="year"
# y-axis="month"
# z-axis(color)="passengers"
######

# Perform imports here:
import plotly.offline as pyo
import plotly.graph_objs as go
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame from  "flights" data
df = pd.read_csv('data/flights.csv')
print(df)
# Define a data variable
data = [go.Heatmap(x=df['year'],y=df['month'],
        z=df['passengers'],colorscale='Jet')]

# Define the layout
layout = go.Layout(title='Frequency of passengers')

# Create a fig from data and layout, and plot the fig
fig = go.Figure(data=data,layout=layout)
pyo.plot(fig)
